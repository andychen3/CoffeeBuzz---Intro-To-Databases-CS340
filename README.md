# CoffeeBuzz---Intro-To-Databases-CS340

Disclaimer:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project was created as part of the portfolio project for CS340 - Introduction to Databases. This project was in collaboration with another student. CoffeeBuzz is a fictitious company that we created.

Project Overview:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CoffeeBuzz is a distribution center that purchases a variety of coffee products from various brands (such as Starbucks and Folgers), and sells these products across the United States. CoffeeBuzz runs similarly to Amazon, with a customer facing website where customers can place orders. Instead of making 5 separate orders from 5 different brandsâ€™ websites and paying exponentially more for shipping, needing to coordinate delivery, etc., customers can purchase all of the items in 1 place from CoffeeBuzz. CoffeeBuzz sells around $1 million in coffee bean products annually to approximately 10,000 customers per year, and this number is growing. CoffeeBuzz needs a database driven internal-facing website to record Orders of Products for Customers.
